I'm a high school computer science and
digital media teacher and for 13 years I
ran and managed creative technology
computer summer camps for middle
schoolers and little younger teaching
animation coding 3D modeling and video
game design in this course I'll be
introducing you to the world of Game Dev
by creating your very own small 3D
platformer video game using two pieces
of software primarily Godot a free and
open source game engine where you can
build and code your own video games and
blender a free and open source 3D
Creation Suite for modeling texturing
and animating 3D models for your games
this course is meant for the absolute
beginner if I can teach this to middle
schoolers well I can teach it to you now
if you already have even a little
experience using blender you'll be able
to take this project even further
otherwise I'll be guiding you step by
step through each phase of building and
programming this project in including
creating a new project in Godot and
starting a game level adding a camera
and a light into the game level and will
add a simple character object we'll
start with a cube programmed to move by
pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard
we'll be breaking down and covering what
I consider to be the top 8 programming
Concepts beginner programmers need to
know to get started coding as we
customize the movement of our character
using Code create collectible objects
coins that disappear when you collide
with them make your character jump and
tilt to align with the floor that he's
standing on make the camera follow and
be able to rotate around the character
create keyframed animations and Trigger
them to switch and play with code we're
going to create enemies that turn around
at walls and edges we're gonna make
moving platforms using tweens a heads up
display on screen to show how many coins
have been collected menu screens with
text images and coded buttons and
because this is a 3D game we'll be using
blender to create a few of our own
custom game assets including a coin
model as well as textured blocks that we
can easily use to construct our game
level lastly we'll finish this project
off by exporting to a standalone windows
program as well as publishing our game
to a popular Indie website itch.io where
a game will be playable right in the web
browser for this course I'll be
providing you with all the assets you'll
need to complete this project right
alongside me I can't wait for you to
join me in creating this 3D platformer
game and entering the world of gamedev
to get started you'll need to install
both Godot and blender if you're using a
laptop I also highly recommend having a
wheel Mouse rather than having a
trackpad or something else I recommend
getting both programs from the official
sources Godot from
godotengine.org we'll go up to downloads
here and I recommend getting the latest
version at least 4.0 I'm going to
download the Windows standard 64-bit
version as that's what will work best
with my computer and it's a surprisingly
small download at just about 51
megabytes it's a zip file downloaded
here to my downloads folder which I need
to unzip so in Windows I'll right click
on it and I'll say extract all
now Godot is a bit of a funny program in
that in Windows it doesn't need to be
installed it's just a standalone program
an exe file I'll go ahead and drag it to
my desktop where I'll keep it throughout
this course please note that in the next
lessons of this course I was actually
using Godot 4.0 before I upgraded to 4.1
if you're using 4.2 or 4.3 or later
there should be just minimal differences
okay you can get blender from
blender.org the latest version of
blender for me is 3.6 though any recent
version of blender 3 or 4 when available
should be fine I'll go up to download or
I'll click to download the version it
recommends in Windows there is an
installation process to go through to
install blender but it's very
straightforward once installed you
should find blender under your start
menu for me it's right here let's go
ahead and get started alright let's go
ahead and jump in and start using the
Godot game engine in this video I'm
showing you how to create a new game
project in Godot and once we're in the
Godot editor I'll be showing you around
its interface so you're not too
overwhelmed with everything that's going
on on your screen inside of Godot and
lastly in this video we're going to
create our very own 3D scene which will
be the main level in our game so let's
go ahead and jump in on my desktop I
have the Godot game engine program right
here when I double click on it if I'm
using a Windows based computer which I
am right now Windows might actually pop
up with a warning about your firewall
settings if that's the case for you you
can make your own best judgment about if
you want to Grant Godot the ability to
access your network and the internet
I'll leave that up to you it actually
doesn't really matter because we're not
going to be using Ado to make
multiplayer online games in this video
so you can go ahead and press cancel or
no or yes it's up to you when Godot
first launches you actually don't see
godot's editor instead you see godot's
project manager which is essentially a
list of all of your current projects if
like me and you probably are you do not
have any projects that you've made with
Godot yet it'll warn you or it'll let
you know that you currently don't have
any projects and it'll ask you would you
like to explore the official example
projects in the asset Library we're
going to go ahead and just say no cancel
because we want to create our project
right away to do that I'll press new
project right here and Godot will pop up
with a window that lets me choose my
project name and also where I want to
save my project on my computer now
here's a warning for you Godot needs to
have an empty folder for every new
project that you create on your computer
in my case on my desktop I'm going to
create a new empty folder right now for
my game project with my game project
name and so to do that what I'll do is
I'll press browse and navigate on my
computer this is all of the files and
the folders in my documents folder you
can see that right up up here on my
computer I don't want to be here my
documents folder is obviously not empty
so I can't create a new project here
because you need a new empty folder for
that so I'm going to press the up button
right here to go up to my user folder
where I have my desktop folder and on my
desktop folder I'm going to create a new
empty folder in just a moment just in
case you want to save to somewhere else
on your computer like another hard drive
or a USB drive that you have plugged in
you can navigate to different drives
right here with different letters on a
Windows based computer okay so on my
desktop I'm going to press select
current folder and when I do that it's
still going to warn me that I can't save
here because my desktop is not empty but
what I can do is I can create a new
folder with my project name right here
so I'm going to type in 3D platformer
game just like that and I will press
create new folder and it'll make it
right here on my desktop so create
folder and the very last thing we have
to do is Select our game engine renderer
if you're not familiar with what this
term means a renderer in 3D or game
engine software means how it will draw
the visual Fidelity of your game in
other words this controls how your game
will look how advanced it'll look and if
it's compatible if your game is
compatible with different types of
platforms including mobile platforms
like Android and iOS phones or if you
even want to put your game on the
internet like it's playable in a web
browser you can select any one of these
options don't worry you can change your
mind later if you want so I'll just
leave mine on Ford plus which will give
me access to the best graphics that
Godot can create so let's go ahead and
press create and edit the project
manager will disappear and the Godot
game engine itself will load when the
game engine loads it's a little bit
intimidating and a little bit Bare Bones
at the same time the main part of
godot's interface in the the middle of
the screen is called the workspace and
the workspace has four different pages
if you will up here at the top you can
switch between working on a 2d interface
in your game this might be for a 2d game
or for a game menu screen there is the
3D workspace page which has access to of
course viewing your 3D space and your 3D
levels next up is the script workspace
where you do all of your coding and
programming in this course we'll be
spending a lot of time here coding in GD
script of course and lastly there is the
asset Library which is kind of like a
store that you can access right inside
of Godot that gives you access to other
people's files projects and resources we
won't spend into any time here at all
we'll be spending most of our time
between the first three different
workspaces right here on the sides of
godot's interface are what are called
docs and docs are basically where you
add everything and change all of the
settings in your 3D environment so they
are actually arguably the most important
part of godot's interface up on the top
left of Godot is What's called the scene
Dock and this scene dock is the most
important part of Godot I would argue
because it's where you add what are
called nodes nodes in Godot are the
building block for everything in your
game all objects in your game all sounds
in your game they are all built here and
if you press the little plus button
right under the word scene you will get
access to all the different types of
nodes that Godot has for you to add now
these nodes again are building blocks of
a game and they are structured in this
window in what's called a node tree a
tree structure is where you have a
parent node that you can expand by
clicking the little arrow next to the
the name and the icon and you can expand
further branches of this tree and
explore all different categories of
different nodes nodes are again every
part of your game so you should
recognize some words here that you could
see being in a game if you want to have
animation in your game you might add an
animation player node if you want to add
sound or audio into a game like music
you would add an audio stream player
node there is a whole category for 3D
objects in your game they are all under
this node 3D branch and if you expand it
out you can see cameras and grid maps
and audio listeners and different types
of collision objects and physics bodies
including one that we're going to be
using a whole lot called a character
body 3D there are Collision polygons
light probes paths skeletons everything
you can imagine that makes up your game
is a node inside of Godot they're very
first know that we're going to add into
our game level and that's what we're
going to be doing over in the scene Doc
is creating our own tree of different
nodes is the basic I'll go and press
plus again is the very first red node
that you can see which will be the basis
or root node of our game level the very
first note that we add is going to be
the node 3D node I don't actually have
to go into this pop-up window to add it
though if I go ahead and press the X to
close this window all I have to do to
add that is press 3D scene it's so
common to start off your scene this way
they have buttons for you here so 3D
scene will create our first node our
root node in our 3D environment
establishing this scene as a 3D scene
speaking of which in the middle of our
screen is our workspace area which shows
us our 3D environment and if you've
never worked in a 3D animation program
before or a 3D game engine before there
are three things you need to know about
how to navigate in this 3D space before
we move any more forward in this lesson
the first thing you need to know about
how to navigate in this 3D environment
is how to zoom in and out and that is
simply if you have a mouse with a mouse
wheel if you put your mouse cursor in
the 3D environment window and you scroll
up and down if you scroll up generally
that will zoom in and if you scroll down
generally that will zoom out be careful
about zooming too far out though because
you might in fact lose track of where
you are in your scene things that are
quite small or in fact normal size in
your environment might disappear so make
sure you're keeping within a range where
you can see once we add objects into our
game level you can still see them there
okay the next thing you need to know how
to do in your 3D environment is how to
orbit orbiting in Godot means to spin
your view around to look at your scene
from different perspectives to do this
press and hold your mouse wheel down
like a button and while you're pressing
down your mouse wheel move your mouse
around when you do this well you'll be
able to see your scene from the front
from the back from the bottom from the
top take a few moments and familiarize
yourself with how to do this and get
comfortable looking at your scene from
any possible Direction either zoomed out
or zoomed in okay if you don't have a
mouse with a mouse wheel that pushes in
like most do you might find it more easy
to go up to this little on-screen Gizmo
with your different axes and simply
click and hold and drag in this little
circular area to do the same thing which
is called orbiting Okay the third thing
you should know how to do is how to pan
around your scene think of how you would
take a panoramic photograph with your
cell phone camera in other words you
would want to look all the way from the
left of your scene to the right of your
scene or perhaps all the way from the
bottom to the Top If You orbit in your
3D environment button instead of just
pressing the mouse wheel down you also
first hold the shift key on your
keyboard and while you're holding shift
you then orbit well it does what's
called panning panning can be from left
to right so you can see from left to
right in your environment or it can be
up and down so be familiar with how to
zoom in and out how to orbit and how to
pan with the shift and orbit middle
Mouse button there we go before we move
forward in this lesson and create a few
elements of our 3D scene and save this
scene as our game level for the rest of
this project there are two more docs on
the screen right now that I want you to
know about and those are on the bottom
left of your screen is What's called the
file system dock this file system doc
shows you all the files that you
currently have in your project folder if
I go ahead and minimize Godot you can
see on my desktop is my project folder
which just a few moments ago was empty
but as soon as we created our game
project Godot actually put some content
in this folder including a very
important file called
project.gado which is our actual game
project that Godot can open we have an
icon dot SVG scalable vector graphics
image file we have a few other settings
and attribute files as well as a DOT
Godot folder which has even more
settings files and other folders in it
once you've made igado project please do
not edit or rename or attempt to
reorganize anything in this project
folder of course you can add things into
the project folder like 3D models
Sprites fonts images things you want in
your game but these need to be here okay
the last dock that I want you to know
about in this video is over on the
entire right side of your screen it is
called the inspector the inspector is
where you can see properties and change
properties of anything that you
currently have selected in your game
specifically nodes that you currently
have in your game level right now my
game level isn't very much in fact
there's only one node so if I go over to
the left side of my screen and select
that node 2D or scenes root node I can
then go over to the other side of my
screen into the inspector and see all of
its properties you can see its name up
here at the top node 3D so once you have
many nodes in your node tree over in the
scene dock well you can select anyone
into these properties over here on the
right the node 3D node has some basic
properties if I expand out their
sections there's a transform section so
I can change the location and rotation
and scale of my 3D world please don't
change any of these settings for any
amount of time unless you'd want to
change them back there is a section
called visibility and yes our world is
visible if I turn it off and on well
that would actually hide game objects
from The editor's View and when I play
my game there are other sections here
that we're not going to use very much
called process and editor description
but depending on what kind of object you
have selected depending on what kind of
node you have selected there will be
different properties for those kinds of
objects speaking of objects and nodes
we're going to add one more object into
our scene and that is one that is
necessary in order for us to see our
game level before we do that let's go
ahead and actually save our scene before
I save I'm going to rename this node
simply by double clicking on its name
right here no node 3D I'm going to call
this level it's root note therefore
level one when you name nodes I'm going
to strongly suggest that you do not put
any spaces or special characters in
their names and that's because you'll be
referring to those nodes sometimes in
code and typically you don't put spaces
in the names of things in any coding
that you ever do okay so level one
capital l no space I'll press enter to
make that final if I want to save this
scene of course I can just go up to the
scene menu and say save scene or I could
press of course control s if I click on
Save scene It'll ask me because I've
never saved this scene before where I
want to save it and what I want to call
this file a scene in Godot is a file
that ends with DOT tscn I kind of think
of the T as silent so a scene if you
will it'll name it with the same name
that you gave your root node in the
scene but it might put underscores when
it recognize those different words and
numbers that's okay I will go ahead and
simply press save and because the path
where I'm saving is my res which is the
same as my scene project folder I'll
press save and it'll be right here level
one dot tscn in my file system talk if I
want to try playing this level or
running it like I would run my game I
could go up and press the play button
but I would suggest that you don't
because when you press play it's going
to ask you to set the default scene in
your entire game project we're not there
yet so instead I'm simply going to press
the play scene or play the current
active scene button right here if I
press it Godot will launch and I will
see my game Run there it is and our game
looks really boring why am I not seeing
the same game world with my sky and my
brown floor
instead I'm just seeing gray well that's
for a few reasons number one in order to
see your world you need to have a camera
in your game level so right now let's
actually go into our scene dock in order
to add a child node to our root note
just like if I were to press the plus
button all of the nodes in this tree
structure have a parent and anything
that's underneath that you can collapse
into that node is a child of that node
this white circle here is the root node
or the parent node of all other nodes in
Godot and when you have a child of this
node that is itself a parent of other
nodes that is called a branch we have to
create this same sort of a tree
structure with parents and children and
branches with their own children in our
scene so before you ever add any nodes
you should always select the node that
you want to be the parent of what you
are about out to add so I'll click on
little icon for level one and I'll press
plus and I'm going to do a little search
here for a camera and if I just type in
camera of course if I don't want to
search I could find the camera 3D for a
3D scene under node 3D and then it's
right here it's called camera 3D in fact
there are different types of cameras but
we'll just select that one and I will
press create when you do that it will
add a child node to the node that you
just had selected which means that we
have a camera 3D in our level one our
camera 3D if I go ahead and zoom way in
you will see it right here and of course
you can use these controls on screen
they are called gizmos to move and
rotate the camera we don't have anything
to look at with our camera but if I just
move the camera back by grabbing the Z
blue movement or transform handle and
then the Y transform to move it up I can
have my camera little bit back looking
at the origin of my scene where the y z
and X axes in my world meet let's go
ahead and see what this looks like if I
press Ctrl s to save and I can go up and
press the play scene button my game will
launch and at least now I can see
through my camera at the middle of my
scene and that is as far as we're gonna
get in this lesson in this lesson we
have covered how to create a new game
project ingado we've done a quick
overview of the different parts of the
Godot editor interface including how to
add nodes to create a game level
including a camera and before that a
root node 3D and we have saved our scene
and tried running our game level it's
worked but we don't have anything in our
game environment yet not even a sky or
an environment as it were we'll be
adding those in the next lessons in this
course but that'll be it for this one
I'll see the next one bye
