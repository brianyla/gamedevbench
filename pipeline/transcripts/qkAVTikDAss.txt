hey what is up guys I'm GX here and
welcome back to a brand new tutorial
series here on the channel so in today's
tutorial series I'm going to be showing
you guys how to make a basic horror game
in gdau now this is only going to be
part one there will be multiple Parts in
this series so if you do enjoy be sure
to like comment and subscribe for more
and without further Ado let's get right
into it so as you can see here I am
opened up in the gdau project manager
and I am using gdau version 4.1.1 for
this tutorial I do recommend that you
guys use a gdau version 4 for this
tutorial so yeah any gdau 4 version
should be fine and uh what we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
creating a new project so when you're in
you're a project manager what you want
to do is you want to find the new
project button and press that and then
what that will do is that will then
bring up the create new project window
so as you can see we can change the
project name so I'm just going to set
mine to horror game tutorial so that's
what my project name will be
called and then as you can see here in
the project path this is where our
project will be created now if you have
R text saying something like you cannot
save a project in the selected path
please make a new folder or choose A New
Path what you do here is you can just uh
click create folder and then boom a new
folder will be created for your project
and then the red text should disappear
and then once you have a green arrow
next to your project path that means
it's all good to go and uh yeah so then
next up we have the renderer options so
we have forward Plus mobile and
compatibility now I will be just reading
off the dot points of what the uh
renderer options do so yeah so for the
forward plus render option it supports
desktop platforms only has advanced 3D
Graphics available can scale to large in
complex scenes uses the rendering device
backend and it has slower rendering of
simple scenes so the forward plus
renderer option is basically the most
advanced renderer in gdau so if you want
to have the best graphics possible in
your game then forward plus is the way
to go however you do need to have a
Vulcan uh compatible GPU in order to use
the forward plus renderer option since
uh the forward plus renderer uses Vulcan
as the primary renderer so yeah and then
we have the mobile renderer option so
this supports desktop Plus mobile
platforms it has less Advanced 3D
Graphics less scalable for complex
scenes uses the rendering device backend
and has faster rendering of simple
scenes so basically this is similar to
the forward plus render option only it's
more for mobile devices and it's less
advanced so I'm pretty sure for this you
still do need a Vulcan compatible GPU
however it is less advanced than the
forward plus renderer options so yeah
and then last but not least we have the
compatibility rendering option so this
supports desktop mobile and web
platforms so if you want to make a web
game then the compatibility option is
the way to go it has the less Advanced
3D Graphics available uh it's intended
for low-end or older devices so if you
have a low-end PC then this might be the
best option for you
it uses openg fre backend instead of the
uh uh Vulcan rendering it uses openg
rendering and then it has the fastest
rendering of simple scenes so uh yeah so
if you want the best performance
available and you don't really care
about Graphics too much or your PC just
can't handle the forward Plus or mobile
renderer options then compatibility is
the way to go but for my tutorial uh for
my project I'm going to be going for
forward plus rendering but uh yeah you
guys are free to choose whatever
renderer you want but for this tutorial
I'm going to be going with the forward
plus option so yeah and anyways once
you're all done you can now create and
edit the project so let's go and now
finally here we are um so once your
project is ready uh it will just be
created and that can take a bit of time
and finally here we are so now here we
are in our project all righty so now
that we're in our new project now let's
get to creating a scene so that we can
actually uh get our player to walk
around when we eventually make our
player controller so what we're going to
do is um so as you can see when you
first launch up a new project you'll be
opened up into an empty scene and to the
left here you'll see a thing saying
create root node now what the root node
is is it's basically like the parent
node of our scene and it's the node in
which every single other node will go
under so imagine nodes as like objects
in unity if you're someone who usually
uses Unity a lot nodes are sort of like
objects in unity so yeah so what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
creating a 3D scene and there we go so
now we have a node 3D in our scene and
this is going to be like the parent root
object of our scene so what you can do
is you can actually double click it to
rename it and I'm just going to rename
my node to level you guys can name it to
whatever you like and uh yeah so
obviously we're going to need a surface
for our player to walk around on so
we're going to need to get out some kind
of flooring right well here's what we're
going to do so we're going to click this
plus icon here to add a child node to
the scene and we're going to search up
static body or just static and you
should be able to get it and we're going
to need a static body 3D so if you don't
know what a static body 3D is there is a
description here which says a 3D physics
object I mean a 3D physics body that
can't be moved by external forces when
moved manually it doesn't affect other
bodies in its path so basically it's a
physics body which is static you know it
doesn't move unless you manually move it
like via an animation or something like
that but so what it means here by when
moved manually it doesn't affect other
bodies in its path let me give you an
example of this okay so in my game exus
Slaughter um that game is actually
available to play on it year for free if
you want to try it out I'm in my game
exus Slaughter
um I have platforms which you can jump
on now those platforms are physics body
3DS I think is the correct node for them
I think that's what it's called physics
body 3D let me just look it up yeah uh
wait no it's not um rigid body 3D that's
what it's called so they are rigid body
3DS right but anyways when I was first
doing the uh the platforms they
originally static body 3DS but I found
that when I animated them right the
player when jumping onto the platforms
wouldn't actually move with the platform
but then when I change the type to a
rigid body 3D then the player would
actually move along with the platform
even when they weren't moving so
basically the static body 3D um it's
essentially just used for normal floors
and walls and stuff like that you know
just normal object Collision you know
like when the player or another object
collides with like a floor or a wall or
you know just another a movable object
then the static body 3D is what you'll
use for order so let's get out of static
body
3D and so now that we have out our
static body 3D as you can see there is
like a yellow caution sign next to it
and let's read what it says so it says
this node has no shape so it can't
Collide or interact with other objects
so what we need to do is we need to add
a collision shape to our static body 3D
now I'm just going to rename this to
floor you guys can rename it to whatever
you like yeah so we're going to be uh
right clicking on the floor and then
we're going to be going ad child node
and we're going to add some Collision to
this so we're going to go Collision
shape
3D and then once you have your Collision
shape 3D you're going to go to where it
says shape in the inspector and you're
going to click on empty and then you're
going to select new box shapes since you
know you want to walk around on a floor
so uh you would either get out a box uh
collider or um let's see what else there
is um actually yeah I think that is
probably the best one for a floor is the
uh box collider the box shape 3D so
consider going with that and uh
yeah so that there is our static body 3D
kind of setup but we do need a mesh to
render our floor since as you can see
right now our floor is currently
seethrough and we can just see the
outlines of the collider so how do we uh
get uh like a cube say for example to
represent our floor what we do is we
right click on our uh on our static body
3D node the flooor node we go ad child
node and then we go mesh instance 3D and
this is what's used to render objects in
gdau so in the inspector with your mesh
instance 3D selected you just want to go
to where it says mesh click on empty and
then you guys can either get out a quad
mesh if you want that to be a floor or a
plane mesh even but I'm going to be
going with a box mesh oh sorry I
accidentally just got out a capsule um
I'm going to be going with a box mesh
for this tutorial so there we go and now
we have a basic uh cube in our scene so
that there is basically how you set up a
cube in
good and what we're going to be doing
with this now is we're going to be
selecting the parent object of the floor
so just the floor
itself and uh we're going to be going
transform and as you can see here we can
actually scale our Cube rotate it
position it whatever you like I mean you
can even just do that with the arrows in
the scene and by changing the tools up
here and whatnot right yeah so as you
can see here with the scale um this here
actually locks the scaling this option
here this little icon here so when you
scale the y- axis for example every
other access will be scaled but if you
want to disable that what you do is you
just click on the icon and then when it
shows the keychain thingy looking
snapped then that means that it is no
longer locked so if you just want to
scale the y- AIS you can do do that
without scaling all the other accesses
as well so
yeah anyways I'm going to now be making
a floor so I'm just going to make this
maybe uh 30X 30 this is just going to be
a test floor so yeah we're not going to
be like making a horrifying scene in
this part of the tutorial that's going
to be saved for another part right now
we're just making a basic scene for our
player to walk on so
yeah and uh what we can actually do here
as well is now that we have floor in our
scene let's add some walls as well to
test out some player collision and stuff
like that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to select my floor and then oh
I've already had it selected so I'm just
going to select my floor and then press
contrl D to duplicate it and this is
going to be one of our walls in the
scene so I'm just going to rename this
to
wall and then I'm going to scale it to
be more like a wall instead of a floor
so if we go to transform um I'm just
going to like set the x AIS to 10 the Y
to five and that to 10 and there we go
so we're just going to set up some basic
Cube looking walls in our
scene and uh so there's
one and then there is
another and there we go so I'm just
going to add like one more and there so
that there is going to be our basic
scene for this
tutorial and then uh if you want to save
just press contrl s and then we can
actually create a new folder for our
scenes and we can call this
scenes and then uh I'm just going to
call this level uh you guys can name
your scene whatever you want but then
just save it and then boom if you look
in your scenes folder in the file system
Explorer thingy as you can see our scene
is now saved in our new newly created
scenes
folder all right so next up I'm going to
be showing you guys how to set up some
basic Lighting in your scene so if you
look here you'll see these two icons
like an earth or a globe looking icon
and then a sun icon so what these are
for is these are used to preview what
your scene would look like if it had
Lighting in an environment but if you
disable it you can actually see what
your current scene lighting and uh
environment would look like but then if
you enable it then you can actually
preview it but yeah so in order to add
some lighting into our scene like some
actual lighting what you need to do is
you need to go to your uh level node or
you can just press the plus icon as well
I'm going to right click go add child
node and we're going to add a
directional light into our
scene and there we go so now our scene
has some basic uh lighting but you might
be thinking wait but there's not really
much change and that's because of the
direction of the light so you can
actually change the direction of it I
think by going into the transform and
then rotating it yeah there we go and
now as you can see the directional light
actually has a bit of impact and we can
add shadows as well you just need to go
to the shadow option on the inspector
and go enabled on and there we go now we
have shadows in our scene and so I'm
just going to rotate this and there we
go so I think that looks good and there
we go now we have some basic Lighting in
our
scene and uh yeah if you want to rename
the directional light that's totally
fine I'm just going to leave it as is
but yeah and I'll actually move it to
the top of the hierarchy as well just so
it's easier to find make sure you save
as well uh press contrl S as you uh
continue going on in case your game
crashes or whatever or your engine
crashes I mean so now with the
environment just click on these three
dots here and uh as you can see we now
have uh some preview environment stuff
so if you actually change some of these
options you can actually preview what
the environment would look like with
these sorts of different options but
yeah so I'm just going to be setting uh
oh I don't think I can set that back to
the default um we'll just set it
something like this you know so yeah
there we go that's a sky color and you
can set the ground color sky energy and
then there's a bit of postprocessing as
well so I think this is like ambient
occlusion then we have glowing and then
tone mapping and then this is like
Global
illumination um but yeah I remember once
enabling that and my whole PC crashed or
my whole engine crashed I think I forget
either way yeah cuz my PC isn't really
the best but you know if you have a good
PC then you can use Global illumination
but be careful if your PC sort of low
end like mine cuz uh yeah then it then
it might cause a bit of issues yeah so
to add the environment to your scene you
just go add environment to
scene oh click it again and there we go
so now we have our world environment and
now as you can see we can no longer
toggle the Sun or Globe options to
preview what it would look like with an
environment or a sun because well now we
already have it in the scene so now we
can no longer preview it so with your
world environment there's a bunch of
different stuff we can change here but
I'm going to be getting to that in a
later part of the series since this
isn't all needed right now but there is
a bunch of stuff to change here I will
tell you guys that so yeah it is pretty
exciting and uh yeah so there we go that
there is how you set up some lighting in
your scene all right so now that we've
got our basic scene set up let's Now set
up our player so what we're going to do
is um at the top here as you can see
with our scenes uh you can actually uh
press the plus icon here to add a new
scene so we're going to add a new scene
and it's going to be a new 3D scene and
what we're going to do is we're going to
rename this to player so this is going
to be our
player and then we're going to right
click on the parent node here and we're
going to change the type of it and we're
going to type up character body 3D and
so the character body 3D this is going
to be used for our character controllers
uh controlling so
yeah so now that we have our character
body 3D what we're going to do is we're
going to give it some Collision so we're
going to right click go add child node
and then search up Collision shape
3D and then we go shape
empty and then we click on new capture
3D and then now we have a capture
Collision for our player now you guys
are free to use whatever sort of
collision you want whether you want to
use cylinder or box whatever but I do
think that using a capsule shape is
probably the best so
yeah so now that we have our Collision
shape in the scene what we're going to
be doing is we're going to right click
in our player again we're going to go
add child node and then mesh instance 3D
and we're going to add uh some visuals
to our player so then we can actually
see our player and its scale and all
that sort of stuff so yeah so we're
going to click on the empty here again
and then we're going to go new capu mesh
and then this will set up a new capsule
in our player so now we can actually see
what our player looks like and it is a
capsule so now if you actually click on
the capsule in the inspector what you
can do here is there's actually a bunch
of different properties that you can set
the radial segments this is actually
used to define like how detailed the
model is so if we set this to something
like 14 as you can see uh it changes uh
it detail a bit if we set it to
something like four it is a lot less
detailed and it's just not that good
quality so yeah so the radial segment
sort of determines the quality of the
shape so I'm just going to set it to
something like uh 14 looks all right I
think 14 looks pretty good and then the
Rings we'll leave at eight I think that
looks all right so yeah and there we go
so now we have our capsu all set
up and then we can actually press
controls to then save our player and you
can go into your scenes folder and then
just press save to then save your player
and then our player is then saved into
the scenes
folder so what we're going to do now is
we're now going to add a script to our
player so you want to uh select your
player then you want to go to where it
says script in the inspector go empty
and then go create new script now what's
interesting about creating a script on a
character body 3D
is it will actually give you a character
body 3D movement template so as you can
see here um you can actually toggle the
template on or off and it says character
body 3D basic movement and yeah so we
can basically just have uh you know some
basic movement already implemented into
our scene and that is really cool about
gdau the fact that it already has like a
character body 3D movement script
implemented into it by default now this
isn't a firsters script by any means we
actually need to do the first person
movement ourselves but this does just
give you some basic movements so yeah
and so what we're going to do is we're
actually going to create a new folder
for this and we're going to call it the
scripts folder oh I'm accidentally
creating it in the scenes folder if you
want to go back a folder you just click
on this Arrow here and then that will
take you to like a a root folder
basically we go create folder we're just
going to create this called scripts and
then we're going to save our script here
just called player and then boom and now
we can save our script if everything
here is green and uh yeah so now let's
go and now as you can see uh we now have
our basic player script and this can be
used for any purposes first person third
person you name it but with first person
there's a bit of a catch and that is
that it doesn't come with camera
rotation you need to actually do that
yourself and that's why we're going to
be creating a camera rotation script but
first before we do get on with that I
want to explain what each part of the
script does so then you guys do
understand it for yourselves so yeah
let's get into explaining so extends
character body 3D that basically just
means that this is a character body 3D
script this is a script that is used for
the character body 3D and then we have
our speed variable well this is called
the constant now I don't really know too
much the difference between like a
constant and a variable i' have to look
a bit more into that but yeah um I can
probably show you a thing here on the
screen right now um just showing what a
constant is compared to a variable so
yeah but uh yeah I I think with a
constant it can't be changed at all cuz
with variables they can be changed
during a scene so if you want to change
the speed of your character uh during
your game right you can do that but if
you are using a constant I'm pretty sure
you can't do that and uh yeah and how I
know that is cuz I've tried to do that
before but in games where I want to
change the player speed I always change
the constant to a just a VAR a variable
so if you want to do that then yeah you
can but uh yeah so basically uh
constants can't be changed during
runtime of your game but variables can
so if you want to use variables instead
of constants you can change uh over to
variables instead of constants but uh
yeah but for now I'm just going to be
using constants we might be changing to
variables later on in a later part but
for now it's just going to be kept to
this since there is no reason for us to
change anything right now and then we
have our gravity so we have a gravity
variable which then equals to what the
setting of the default gravity equals to
in our project settings so if we go into
our project settings um and you search
up
gravity um I think it's here yeah um so
the default gravity value is 9.8 but if
you want to change this you totally can
and then the gravity of our player will
be changed uh based on what the project
settings of the default gravity is set
to so
yeah and then we have our physics uh
process function so this function is
used specifically for physics purposes
so if our player is not on the floor
then its y velocity will go down so
depending on what our graphity equals to
our velocity of our character will go
down uh depending on our gravity then
multiplied by Delta which then will
basically um make our uh our speed of
the player falling time dependent
instead of frame rate dependent because
if it's frame rate dependent then that
would be a bit broken so uh
yeah and then we have the uh jump input
here so if the player presses the UI
accept input we will be changing this
later on um I will be teaching you guys
about the input system later on and the
player is on the floor
then the player's y velocity will equal
to the jump velocity so the jump
velocity is 4.5 so the player will go up
based on the jump
velocity and then we have um so the
input directions so we have a variable
created here called the input Direction
and this will basically just be getting
the input direction of our player's
input based on the inputs we have so UI
left UI right UI up and UI down I'm
pretty sure these are the different
arrow keys but we will be changing these
later on in the tutorial so I will be
getting to that and then we have the
directions so this will be the direction
our player moves in so
yeah and then if our player is moving so
if direction is equal to true so if our
player is moving then the player's X and
Y velocity values will then equal to
Direction Times by the speed so that'll
be multiplied by the speed else if the
player isn't moving and Direction equals
to false then it will just move towards
the velocity value and then it will stop
basically so yeah it will no longer move
the player will just stop and then move
and slide this will basically make our
Player move so yeah and that is the
player script explained so hopefully I
explain that well for you guys and uh
yeah now let's actually uh continue on
with this tutorial so what we're going
to be doing now is we're going to be uh
creating our camera so for our players
camera first off what we're going to do
is um we're going to be going uh player
so we're going to right click on the
player go add child node and then we're
going to search up camera 3D and then
this will add our player I mean sorry a
player a camera to our scene so now
let's position this camera um to you
know just a certain position like the
head of our player and there we go I
think that is a good position through
our camera and also make sure that the
camera is facing in uh this particular
direction here facing the blue line so
if you actually look up here you can
actually see like the direction of which
I am facing so the camera is currently
facing the opposite of the Z Direction
and this is actually forward so we want
to make sure that our player is facing
in this direction specifically um
opposite of the Z AIS because you know
that is forward and gdau and uh yeah I
used to always think that you know
facing towards the Z was forward but it
isn't it is actually facing uh opposite
of the Z yeah that is forward and
gdau and now with our camera 3D we're
actually going to uh right click on this
and then we're going to go down to
reparent to new node so we're going to
be giving it a parent object and it's
just going to be a standard node 3D and
I'm going to call this head so this is
going to be the head of our uh player or
the head of our camera now um wait
something that I just noticed is um it's
not really positioned right here wait so
uh when you add a when you add the head
to your camera 3D something which I just
noticed is it adds it into the middle of
the uh scene so you know it just zeros
it out basically at the middle of the
scene but the problem with that is is
now our camera isn't positioned right
with the parent object so what you want
to do is if this happens to you you want
to drag out your camera 3D from
underneath the head and then you want to
make the head a child object of the
camera camera 3D and then you want to
zero out the position of your camera 3D
so I mean of your head sorry so we're
just going to set the Y AIS to zero and
now it is positioned perfectly with
where our camera is positioned and then
if we uh make the camera 3D a child
object of the head again and then boom
it should all be
fine so yeah that there is how we set up
the uh player's camera and our scene but
now what about the script well let's get
to that guys so what we're going to do
is we're just going to save there and
then we're going to go uh click on
script so make sure that you have your
head selected you want to make sure that
you have your head node selected then
you want to go click on script empty new
script and then uh for this I'm just
going to be calling the script camera
and we're going to be saving it in the
scripts folder and unfortunately there
is no template for a camera like
movement script at all so there's no
camera rotation script unfortunately uh
that would be nice if there was a
template for that but there isn't but so
here's what we're going to do we're
going to create a
script and there we go so now let's get
started with this all right so to start
off for this script what we're going to
do is we're going to get rid of the
starter stuff here and we're going to
enter our a new variable so it will be
called VAR sense and this is short for
sensitivity and I'm going to make this
equal to
0.005 now you guys are free to set this
to whatever you want to but I'm just
going to set it to
0.5 and there is a reason as to why it
needs to be set to so low and uh by the
time I actually you know show you guys
how to do this camera script if you want
to try setting it to a much higher value
and seeing what I mean then yeah you
guys will get what I mean as to why we
need to set this to such a low value but
uh yeah so what we're going to be doing
to start off here is we're going to be
doing a ready function so we're going to
go Funk uncore ready so what ready is
for is this is for like at the start of
our scene so when our game starts then
the ready function will do its thing
automatically so
yeah so what we're going to be doing now
is we're just going to go indent and
then we are now going to type in the
following input. set Mouse
mode and then we're going to then enter
input. mous mode captured so what this
is going to do is this is going to set
our Mouse mode like our cursor you know
my cursor that you can see moving around
right now to the captured mode and what
that does is it locks our cursor to the
middle of the screen and it makes it
invisible so then our cursor isn't
moving around and stuff as we're playing
our game so then it's just locked to the
middle of our screen and as we're
rotating our player around our cursor
isn't moving around at all and hitting
the edges of screens and stuff like that
so yeah so that's what setting our Mouse
mode to input. mous mode capture does
all righty so what we're going to do now
now that we have our ready function
ready is we're going to we're going to
go down the line and then indent back to
here and then go down another line and
then we're going to write Funk uncore
input and then we're going to do
parentheses and then event and then the
two dots and then input
event and then after that we're then
going to then go hyphen or Dash whatever
that's called and then arrow and then
void oops sorry
void and then you just want to do the
two dots again and then uh you just want
to then indent and then you want to
write if event is input event Mouse
motion so basically if our Mouse is
moving uh then we do the two dots getor
parent so what get parent does is this
actually gets our player object since
the player object is the parent object
of our head so we're going to do uh get
parent Dot and then rotate uncore Y and
then in parentheses we're going to do uh
minus event. relative dot oh sorry dox
and then we're going to multiply that by
our
sensitivity and uh yeah so that there is
US rotating our player on its y AIS so
you know that just means rotating left
and right based on on the left and right
movements of our Mouse so
yeah and then we're going to go down a
line and for this one we're just going
to go rotate uncore X and then in
parentheses we're going to go event.
relative well minus event. relative doy
multiplied by sents and so what this is
going to do is this going to rotate our
actual head itself on the x axis so when
we move our Mouse up and down that will
then rotate our head up and down so our
player will rotate left and right and
the uh head will actually rotate up and
down that is how it is going to work
with this and now last but not least we
need to actually clamp our camera's
rotation so we're going to go rotation
dox equals clamp and then in parentheses
rotation
dox and then a comma and then de under _
to rad and if you're wondering what this
does uh deore to rad it basically
changes uh it basically converts the
degrees to radius or radons or something
like that whatever it's called I forget
what the actual term is I've looked it
up in the gdau um uh documentation
before but yeah it's like degrees to
radius or something like that I'm pretty
sure you guys um I'll probably show a
thing here on the screen uh if I'm you
know a bit confused on that but yeah so
you want to do degrees to radius or just
D to rud for short and then in here you
just want to write 90 or whatever value
you want so whatever you want to clamp
your camera's um rotation to then that
is you know totally fine you can set the
value to whatever you like but I'm going
to be setting it to
90 and then what we're going to be doing
is we're then going to be doing another
comma and then we're going to basically
just be copying and pasting this and
we're going to set this to 9 so this
will be our minimum uh our minimum clamp
and this is our maximum clamp so
yeah so the minimum clamp I have set is
90 I mean negative 90 and then the
maximum clamp is 90 so this will
basically allow our player to look fully
up and down but not look in a 360°
rotation so yeah and uh yeah so that
there is how we do our camera script it
is pretty basic so anyways once you're
done with your script you just want to
press us to save it and there we go and
now our camera should actually be ready
like our player should actually be ready
to be used so what we're going to do is
we're going to go into our level scene
so we're going to switch back to our
level scene and then uh from our scenes
folder I'm actually going to then drag
in our player and now we have our player
in our scene all right so with our
player now in the scene let's now
position it so then it is in a good
position and there we go there is our
player and boom we now now have our
player in the scene now before we do use
our player there is one last thing that
we need to do and that is setting up the
input system so I'm just going to save
the scene and uh yeah so now we're going
to be setting up the input system so I'm
going to be going project project
settings and then input map and here is
where we can set our inputs so I'm going
to be setting uh a new input called
forward
backward left
right and then last but not least jump
so here are our five inputs that we're
going to be doing for this tutorial so
you want to CLI on uh CL you want to
click on the plus icon on each uh on
each uh input basically so on forward
for example click the plus icon and if
you press a certain key on your keyboard
like the W key for example now I'm going
to press the W key because in order to
move forward in most games you usually
press the W key so yeah
so we have the W key which will be set
for our forward input and by the way you
can set a controller inputs if you want
to as well so if you want to set
controller inputs that's totally fine
you can do that so yeah but uh what
we're going to be doing now is we're
going to be setting the backward input
to
S and then the left input to a right
input to D and then last but not least
the jump input to space and there we go
so now we have all our five main inputs
set for this character controller and
now we can save and if we go into our
player script we can actually then
change these uh input uh names here so
UI accept can be changed to jump or
whatever the name of your jump input
is UI left can be changed to left UI
right can now just be right UI up is now
forward and UI down is now backward and
there we go now our player is fully set
up so now what we can actually do is um
if you actually click on your uh scene
in your scenes folder like your actual
main uh level and you right click on it
you can actually set that as your main
scene so if you ever click the play icon
in your uh in your in your project and
you want to test out your game uh then
it will just load up into your main
scene automatically but yeah so what
we're going to do is we're going to
press the play button and we're going to
test out and see if this all works and
boom as you can see I can now freely
move around and jump around and yeah
everything is working
perfectly so if you guys did enjoy this
tutorial or you did learn something from
it be sure to like comment and subscribe
for more in part two we'll be doing a
bunch more stuff I haven't thought of
what we'll be doing for part two yet but
I will be planning it so yeah but
overall what we've done in this tutorial
is I've showed you guys how to set up a
gdo project I've showed you guys um how
to set up a basic scene how to set up
some some basic lighting uh how to set
up a basic firstperson player controller
and I think that is quite a big
achievement for this part so yeah
anyways again guys if you did enjoy it
be sure to like comment and subscribe
for more tutorials like this in the
future and I'll see you all next time
bye-bye
