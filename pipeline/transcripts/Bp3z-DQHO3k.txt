user interface in 3D is often used in
games to display health bars markers and
information in this video we will take a
look at how you can achieve this and
source code for this project is down in
the description and if you find this
helpful please subscribe so let's dive
in so open up goo and let's start with
making a health bar so make this a 3D
scene and we want to add a child so hit
the plus button and search for sprite 3D
and add that as a sh for this and
texture for this will be a viewport so
we will add a
viewport and now we can set the size for
the view port and I'm going to just make
this 1920 by 1080 so if we open up the
Sprite 3D and on the texture we will
select viewport texture select the
viewport and press okay and now if we
zoom out we will see the texture and
it's basically getting the 2D viewport
so as a sh to the viewport we will add
they called progress bar now we have
added a progress bar and we can see it
here in the top left corner and we can
see that it's pretty small so I'm going
to go into the layout and on size and
transform and I'm going to increase the
size to something more reasonable let's
say
1,000 and maybe 100 on the thickness I'm
going to go into the 2D view since the
progress bar is at 2D node and in in the
top middle here I'm going to Anchor the
preset to the middle if we go back into
the frey view we will now see it in the
middle and we see this gray background
and basically go into this sub view port
and enable transparent background that
will make the background transparent and
we will only be able to see the progress
bar I'm going to set the value to
something like 50 on the progress bar we
can actually see it back to free view
and now we can see the value is set to
50 and we can set the steps to something
like one that's how much it will move
each step when we change the value so
now you it's moving in increments of one
and if we take it back to 0.1 you will
see it's moving in increments of 0.1 so
I'll like one and keeping it at 50 I
will make a simple script on the Node 3D
and create a new script and on the
process we will remove the pass and drag
in the progress bar and then we select
the progress bar and we want to get the
value so the progress bar do value minus
equal one so that will make it lose one
over time so we can see it I'm going to
run the scene and we can check it out I
realized we don't have a camera so we
can't actually see it so I'm going to
close this down and add a
camera we will add a camera and if I
press contrl alt M while selecting the
camera it will will snap to our view now
if we run the scene we will see it went
down really fast we're going to increase
the max value to something like 1,000 so
we can actually see what's happening and
set the value to 1,000 as well I'm going
to run the scene and we can now see the
progress bar going down really fast and
if we select the Sprite we can actually
make it rotate to the direction we're
looking at from the camera and that's
called a billboard so if we select the
Sprite 3D we can go into the flags on
Billboard enable this you can either do
enable and that will be in every
direction so it's always facing you or
you could do a y billboard and that only
makes it face you on the Y I like the Y
billboard more but you could use a
regular billboard as well sometimes you
will have objects I'm going to put in
object here to show you what I mean
because sometimes you have a object
that's inside of the Sprite and that
will make it not visible so right now we
have Susan here and she's really pretty
but she's blocking the view of the
Sprite and you might want your progress
bar or your UI to show in front of the
models and to make sure it's showing in
front we go into no depth test and we
check this and it will make it render
always in front of everything else but a
negative with this is it will always
render in front of everything everything
so this is probably best if you make it
only show the Sprite when you're close
to it so something like Interac that it
shows when you're focusing it or
interacting with it but it hides when
you're not interacting or focusing on it
I'm going to also show this with
something else than a progress bar for
example a panel with some labels and a
text so I can just either duplicate this
Sprite 3D or I can add more nodes in
inside of the sub view Port but for this
example I'm just going to duplicate the
Sprite 3D and I might have to change the
texture to this other one so I'm going
to make this unique because it might be
linked to the other one and select it
and select this new one I should
probably rename them I'll do that later
here we're going to remove the progress
bar select our viewport and we can add
for example a panel go back into the 3D
view to see what's actually happening
and we can see it up here in the top
right we can change the custom minimum
size to something bigger so let's make
this like 500 by 500 and I'm going to
Center this go into 3D View and I want
it under the health bar so I'm going to
move it down on the Y position let's
drag it down under it now I want to add
some text so we can add a
label Center this onto the panel and we
can call it
Susan I'm going to make it not not as
tall so I'm going to make it 100 not a
good idea to do custom minimum size I'm
going to just change the size because it
doesn't let you change it as easy so 100
on the Y and let's do 1,000 on this as
well Center it and on the position on
the Y move it up above the health bar so
this will basically be the name tag of
Susan I'm going to increase the font
size so search for font and font size go
into the 3D view so we can actually see
what's happening and there we go it is
perfect and then you could add anything
for example you could add Sprites like
Sprite 2D inside of this and that would
show as well I'm going to zoom out a
little bit select the camera and contrl
ALT M and now if we run this we can see
everything
better and right now we can see Susan
and that's probably because I need to
add the world environment and the Sun so
I'm going to do that as well run the
scene again
and now we can see our beautiful suzan
her health bar and her name and this is
basically how I did it in a game I'm
working on right now Forge front and you
can wish list it on Steam right now I
have the no depth on but I also have
this only visible when you're close by
it and then I have a interactable I will
link a video down in the description on
how you can make a interactable and then
on my furnace script I connected the
focused and and unfocused and this is
how you can do something similar to what
I have done so add an animation player
that place the Sprite 3D going from
visible to Invisible and then you can
just play it and play it backwards so
playing it backwards will make it
visible and playing it will make it
invisible so when it's not focused it
will play it making it invisible and
when it's focused playing it backwards
will make it visible and I'll show you
how I made it so it's made out of a
panel with another panel inside of it or
actually a couple panels a couple of
labels I think it's just one label yeah
with all the text because it would be
annoying to change a bunch of labels for
the different values because this
changes when you upgrade it then there's
also a couple of Sprites so the coins
and the heart and as you can see inside
of the furnace and also rotating on the
Y because otherwise it might look a
little bit weird with it facing outwards
I like the look of this a lot better
thanks for watching if you want to
support my work check out my Kofi in the
