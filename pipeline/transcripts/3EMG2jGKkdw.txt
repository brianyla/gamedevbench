hello and welcome to a new video it has
been quite some time and it's always a
lot of work making videos what happened
since the last video I changed my job
almost two years I was working at some
engineering on the product called
risotto I was also working on that using
the Godot engine and you probably saw me
posting videos somewhere I played in the
background so now I'm working at bipin
bits you may have heard of it they
recently released domekeeper and am now
a part of the core team it has been a
really awesome first month super
exciting job I am working there also
working in gudo it's a ton of fun a
great team I also recently released the
demo for godo4 called desert light I was
working on it for yeah quite some time
about the most of the time was spent
waiting now for music and finishing up
the assets optimizing everything a
little bit the first iteration that I
was showing on social media yeah was
very high poly and yeah not very well
optimized but you can get it now I put a
link in the description and you can
check it out if you like and what I want
to do in this video so much talking just
for the intro but let's get to the video
what I want to do today is to build a
scene and go to four using the assets of
desert light so we're going to build a
3D scene and I'm going over some
settings of the world environment I'm
going to give some tips on composition
of your scene and yeah I'm just starting
building it usually I have a very strong
concept for a video but this time I will
just start out and we'll see where it
takes us and we'll play around with some
settings and yeah hopefully in the end
everything will look cool and if I
encounter something that I want to talk
about a bit more in depth while I work I
will just stop working godo and explain
those Concepts and so it will be a very
open format video I hope you will enjoy
it and let's Jump Right In I opened the
original demo scene to start out and
then let's create a new scene let's call
it demo 2 how very creative
and first I want to start out by
blocking out the scene so to get an idea
of what we will be building
um to do that I get a mesh instance
let's put a box mesh on it
let's make it 10 by 10 meters like this
yeah and now the blank canvas syndrome
maybe we can build something so I
duplicate those and then just move them
around
and like this I will quickly block out
the main scene
maybe we can do something like a cool
Canyon or
something the like
so by pressing t or pressing this button
here you can use local space space which
is pretty cool to move stuff around
and I like to switch between using local
space and
World space quite often
so yeah it's let's do a canyon but
without a roof Maybe
and then something in the center
to make it more interesting
if I want to change the shape of the
mesh I will just go in here
a grid like this but you can also just
change the scale of the object
and then some kind of bridge
by using middle Mouse you can move the
camera
by holding shift and using middle Mouse
you can Pan the camera
so let's find the main perspective it
should be something like this for the
scene
I think I want this side to be higher
just to make it a bit more asymmetric
asymmetrical and make it more
interesting maybe we can also make it
like this
let's give some interesting shape and if
we combine it with something over here
could look really interesting
then we could make some kind of entrance
here for a cave or an old ruin
all right
so let's also add a new node 3D let's
call this lights
let's add a directional light
I think I want this to come in here
let's enable shadows and have a look how
it works
so right now I'm looking
in how I want the light to look in the
scene in a general sense like of course
we are going to move the light around
but the first step I want to get an
impression how the light could be
interacting with those different
geometries in the map
for example you see this part here
will look pretty interesting and I want
stuff to like this to happen like
objects that catch a little bit of the
light
for example if I use this
and bring it up I can create a very
interesting shape here for a shadow
and also create a more interesting shape
up here where the light is catching this
little edge of what will eventually
later be a stone or something like that
so let's scale this a bit
like this
and also this over here
this and the ground plane
and now we're starting to see some
interesting shapes
by the way with this button here we can
disable the environment
sometimes it's good to get a more clear
view and
to have everything else disabled
but we can keep it off for now
okay so now I have this and maybe I want
some more rocks to come down from the
front and have some kind of Canyon
opening
so again composition if I move this here
I'm losing this interesting shape this
interesting contrast here with this
Stone
so I don't want this I can of course
tilt it a bit
and now again I'm getting this
interesting shape to stick out
from the floor get it to look much more
interesting and I can do the same thing
here I can just tilt this
bring it down a bit and then I will have
a much more interesting line
leading up here
So eventually I won't be doing this too
crazily but I can just leave it in for
now and
maybe look later how it looks how it
works out
but yeah we can also do something like
this
this looks cool I like this
maybe a bit less
okay so I think for the main geometry
this looks interesting enough
let's pull this down a bit more and here
in the back I will do some kind of
opening and maybe cave or
you can also use Stones something like
that
I want to tilt this a bit more to
point in this direction a bit more
and now we could do two things we can do
this
and if you follow this line and this
line it will point over here
or we can do this
and then the lines will point a bit more
toward this corner here
so if we put something here that looks
interesting it should work out
um ideally we want everything to point
to the cave entrance so we can try
rotating this
like this
and this
like this
let's check out
we give this a more neutral Edge
this
I mean we could do it like this but I
don't like it too much let's go back
I like this much more even if it points
up to the sky
but um
the overall shapes look more interesting
but also a bit conflicting
I'm a bit torn let's put it like this
so now we have this line here pointing
towards the entrance we have this line
here pointing towards the engines we
have this line here pointing towards the
entrance a lot of lines that point
towards the entrance this makes it a bit
more Dynamic I think this will be fine
you can of course also tilt those
so they point a bit more towards the
entrance of the the thing
angle is like this
so now everything is almost everything
this one not
but I like it so much so I will leave it
in
all right
now we have this
um
eventually we should put something more
to the top why because if we are going
to add some volumetric fog
and we have this directional light from
the top right
the directional light from the top right
then everything will be flooded with fog
so we have a couple of options here
um I usually just like to put more stuff
on top of the scene if you want to work
with volumetric volumetric fog
but I want to for this video
and we put it here
and I pull it a bit to the front like
this it could look interesting
so now we have more stuff that casts a
shadow here
and stuff that cuts the shadow is good
because then we will have more
interesting volumetric later
I miss however seeing a bit of this guy
maybe we can fix that by turning it a
bit
I like this and now we have a little bit
of Sky peeking through here and here
and like does the scene looks
interesting enough
let's put in a camera so we kind of save
this viewing angle and we can come back
to it
so I try to align this camera with our
view
and if we click this button we get this
perspective and I think it matches up
pretty good all right let's jump out of
this now I don't need this anymore and
let's look at this mess from the outside
it looks very crazy
so what I want to do right now to fix
this as a first step
we take all of this and now we look for
some
good angle to set up our scene let's
look from the top because if I start
like this everything will be turned it
makes no sense so let's just
let's just take this and rotate it so we
have at least
some kind of alignment
with the world space
let's put it in the center like this
and now it makes a bit more sense
all right
and it looks the same we moved
everything we moved to light we move the
camera so everything will be fine
let's
um
lock the light for now and lock the
camera so we don't accidentally move it
and then we're going to replace what we
just built with some assets
and I have some assets here from the
demo scene
I have some meshes that we imported for
example those those torches or those big
rocks
those ones
but I already prepared scenes with them
and this is something I would advise to
do so you just have a couple of scenes
um Bass scenes like for example the
rocks
I have this big rock it also already has
a Collider
so if you want to move around as the
player later it will be much easier to
do so
and this is the version with the normal
map I'm not sure if I will keep this
somehow it doesn't look too great so
anyway let's put in some rocks
and now you can see
um
the rock is way too big
but I know that The Rock has more or
less the right scale so
let's do one thing let's jump over to
the main scene let's grab our player
and let's put the player in the scene
and then let's have a look on how big he
is I scale the player that is probably
super dumb
yeah I think I want to make everything a
little bit bigger the best way to do
this is to add a new node
let's throw everything in there
first we need to unlock those
two and then let's throw everything in
here
and now we can scale this
so maybe something like this
where's our player
yeah maybe even bigger I want it to be a
bit more
Epic
maybe like this
yeah
all right let's hop into the camera you
see it didn't really change which is a
good thing
we should move the camera down more
towards the eye level of the player
to get a better impression of how
everything will look
and let's keep it there but move it down
like this
and now everything looks a bit bigger
but it also changed the
the whole composition so now we have to
get back in and maybe change a thing or
two
I mean I like it but um
it's not what I originally had in mind
whoops
but yeah I think it's fine if you look
up it looks pretty epic and cool and
that's what we want so
but this angle here is maybe a bit too
weak this one here
well I guess this looks interesting
enough it looks a bit too big but maybe
we can break it up with some smaller
shapes and I also want to scale down
this rock a little bit
but yeah let's build the scene
so
I have the rock here
let's start
putting rocks where those other things
are
I will make it a little bit smaller
and now let's replace those blocks
with proper assets
and as this is not Unreal Engine we
can't use
qixel or stuff like that and I also want
to go for a more
um
stylized look
and with this um
using those assets here makes much more
sense
let's also get the ground in
I'm using the same ground sand that used
for the other scene eventually I'm going
to replace it
but for now it's going to be fine
like I said this doesn't have to be
perfect I'm probably going in later and
just fix everything up
but I want to get the basic block out
done rather quickly
all right we finished with blocking out
the scene
so if we look in the camera it looks
pretty much like what we have blocked
out it's not so straight this one is a
bit wobbly and this one too
but this will be fine
um let's see if we can put everything we
build into another node
and then we will compare it how it looks
it doesn't have to be a perfect match we
are not bound by law to make it look
exactly like what we had played our
planned out and laid out in the
beginning
but it's interesting to see if there are
any major differences
so
now let's hide it
let's go into the camera
and let's see how it compares
it's a bit different
it's more organic
um
so what do I like what do I don't like
let's let me do this
and let's open it up in here
and let's make a quick analysis of what
we see
it doesn't have to be perfect or
anything I just want to go over some
things that I like and maybe don't like
so what I don't like
is that this is a bit round to round for
my tastes I would like it more if it's
straight the same here
I don't like it it looks like an arc and
the same here like the slide angle
is something I don't really like because
this is the only place where it's where
it's looking so organic apart from the
ground but in the back here it looks
very straight
lines are connected very straight and
something else I don't like it's this
part here this little window
it breaks up the shape too much
maybe we can fix it by closing this
triangle here
and
right now
it has a bit of an off balance I mean in
the end if we move the camera around if
we walk around as the player of course
we're not having this fixed perspective
that we have right now but at the moment
this side here
looks much
heavier
than this side over here it's also
caused by the light of course but
um
if we would have a rendering or a fixed
scene I would take away some
volume from this side
so let's go back and godo and let's fix
those problems
um so first these here
these are pretty easy to fix
we just try to get into the right
perspective and now maybe you can rotate
it to get a straighter Edge
or maybe I just need to rotate it a bit
like this and move it upwards and now we
have a much more straight line we still
have the surrounding thing here which is
probably caused by how the mesh is
shaped
maybe like this and this also gives us
like a little nice opening here
and here on the second one
we kind of have the same issue but maybe
we can get away with just moving this
down a bit more and maybe we can even
open it up eventually it would look
interesting or it will look interesting
let's jump into the camera
I think I even like it more like this
gives it a much more interesting shape
against the sky
and now all that's left is this corner
up on the top here
um what is this thing doing here
better much better
okay
just triangle here I think I like it
with the new opening
you can leave it now in there
we have like one small thing over here
where the meshes
interact in a not so nice way let's pull
this forward a little bit
okay now we've done this part
let's do
let's add some more details so now we
have the big shapes out of the way we
can start focusing a bit more on detail
let's add some ground detail let's add
the opening in the back here
and then we can work with light a bit
more okay to add detail of course you
need small things I have a couple of
rocks prepared that are smaller
I call it debris
you see this is some Temple debris but I
think I also have some smaller no we
don't want to write some smaller rocks
that we can use for
okay
um we're just gonna use this debris here
and probably just change the material
override
I think this looks
neutral enough so we can use it
let's grab this material from here
move over here and
let's just make it local
maybe this is not the best way to do it
but um
this is the way that we are going to do
it right now
we don't want stuff like this to be
floating
so I rather check it two or three times
and it's going to be like a little
wasteful using those big pieces and then
just letting them stick out of the
ground a little bit
but
for this demo it should be fine
so what I want is this
small rocks or smaller rocks that stick
out of the ground a bit
I fast forwarded this part where I'm
just putting down more detail and more
of the temple assets from the other
scene
and then I start building up the
entrance to this tunnel like thing also
using the assets from the other scene
and yeah wanting to add more details and
made it integrated better to the
environment
and then just building this little
tunnel and of course this is not the way
that I would build something for like a
proper game I would create assets that
are really specialized for that use case
but for that demonstration here it
should be fine
and I'm also placing two lights on the
left and to the right just to make it
look more interesting
and then I decided to add some stairs
leading up to some Giant mountain that
should be visible on the horizon
and yeah I was experimenting with how to
play steps if I can play some steps that
are visible in the back but I failed and
gave up on that idea so I just placed
some pillars on the Rock in the
background and that should be fine for
this demo to give some background to
give some context by the players
okay I think
um this is it from
modeling perspective we could say
of course we could add more detail I
could create more assets etc etc
but for now I think it's good we should
start looking into yeah pulling getting
some nice lighting and
creating some atmosphere
like I said we could continue on this
forever
but
[Music]
that's not what this video should be
about so let's do one quick check how
the light looks
I think it looks pretty cool we can get
some really nice mood on the back Rock
there
with the sun going down
and maybe we could add one more thing
here
imagine if the sun goes down
and it's already at this angle I think
it would look really cool if we add one
Rock here and the background basically
that is not necessarily to be seen But
if we put it at the right position
then we could eventually get a nice
shadow
on here
now you can see the shadow range is not
enough
we need to go into the light
and in the shadow
here we can see the maximum distance if
we turn this up we also get a shadow
here in the back
let's put this to 400
and then let's do
this so we get a nice interesting Shadow
shape going on
when basically the Sun is going down
like this
and hopefully as a player we won't see
this
we're down here in this
Ellie more or less and if the sun goes
down we will get this nice
shadow
eventually we will get also some
artifacts but this is fine alright
so far so good
I think it looks pretty cool
of course it's not perfect like we will
have some bleeding going on here at this
at the
stairs this is far from perfect maybe we
can just quickly add some blocker here
I already created this thing here
and we can just copy it and move it over
to the stairs
and do something like this
to just block the light
and also at the moments that are
annoying
but anyway
like kind of like this it should work
out to block most of the problems
let's hop into the camera
and let's start working with an
environment
so we add a world environment node
and you can already see instantly that
the mood of the scene changes so the
first thing I want to do is add a new
environment
set the background to Sky
now go into Sky create new Sky we create
a procedural sky and now we have a sky
we can set we can set the sky colors
and this also influences how the scene
looks
okay
now for the ambient light we can take it
from the background and what ambient
light does is it will add a light to the
overall scene so if we turn down the
energy here
you can see
that we will have much harder harder
Shadows and if we turn off the
directional light here
why is it scaled
huh all right
if you turn off the light here you can
already see that it changes the view of
this overall scene or how it looks quite
dramatically I don't know why some of
the materials are still lit eventually
it's
it's because of the materials let's
check this out real quickly Boop
we can do it from the camera
the material should be named Temple
eventually it has some backlight going
on
no
ah it's probably the reflection of the
sky
yeah okay
all right
that's not a big problem
all right
um so back into the world environment
the sky contribution basically tests are
seen how much
the sky material that we just created
here
is influencing the overall light
situation in this scene so if we turn
this up to one and we go back into the
sky
and for example we change the energy
here
that will also influence how our scene
looks
and if we change the color here it will
also change how our scene looks so this
is quite important
to create
a first overall look of your scene if
you don't have a sky material of course
this will look completely different if
you have an indoor scene or a dungeon
where there's no Sky you will probably
have no ambient light and you have to
work more with placing light scenes that
is also perfectly fine and we can later
change the sky material so it's more
like a night scene and then we can talk
a bit about the differences there so for
now let's put it in some bluish
shoe
here
and yeah let's get back into the ambient
light
um I don't want too much Sky
contribution I want it to be more like
this
yeah
we can also disable it of course by the
way
all right
so what else do we have reflected light
in this case it's the background we can
also disable it now you can see the
influence that we just um played around
with from the specular from the
specularity it's gone now
and maybe I even put it on disabled so
we have more control about the overall
look of the scene
tone map is a quite important setting
here you can create and control how the
exposure of the scene Works how it's
how it looks basically if we switch
those modes here at the moment it's not
going to have a dramatic influence but
if we set up everything and the light
sources in there I will come back to
this
for now I set it to filmic that's what I
usually use
so this screen space Reflections let's
leave it off for now
um this is screen space ambient
occlusion and we can enable it and have
a look at it what it does
so ambient occlusion is basically
creating
Shadows or a dark area where two objects
or two surfaces are close to each other
for example if we put another mesh here
[Applause]
okay so if we move this closer to the
ground you can see this dark area that
will appear
and that is the ambient occlusion so two
objects are close to each other and they
create this dark area I really like the
effect I usually play around with the
value a bit I usually make it a bit more
intense so you can see now like this you
can control the intensity
can control how it falls off
so you can go really crazy with those
values the detail value it doesn't seem
to do too much
Horizon so how it's fading out
sharpness
also doesn't seem to do a lot
anyway let's turn this down a bit again
let's increase the radius a little bit
not too much otherwise it starts to look
weird so I think like this it looks okay
let's leave this in here now so we have
a reference
this is indirect light and if we turn
this on it also adds yeah kind of those
occlusions and also Reflections all
right let's
um turn our light on so we get an
impression on how the scene looks and
you can start it slowly you can see it
slowly starts to look more interesting
from the light aspect
we can also just save this here
and let's save it into resources and
let's call it rougher environment two
and like this we can quickly turn it off
and turn it on again
all right
so you can see if we enable and disable
it
you can see here how the light
hits the ground and the yellow light
from the ground is reflected back onto
the surface
this is what screen space indirect
lighter does
you can also change the radius
now you see how the influence
is scattered more
maybe we turn it down a little bit to
get a more intense effect
we can also control the intensity but
then it starts to look really weird
and the sharpens
but again this doesn't do too much
so let's keep it on the normal setting
all right scientist and field Global
illumination this is an interesting one
especially for outdoor scenes you can
see if we enable it it starts to make
look everything weird
but yeah maybe we can play around with
it a bit and get some more interesting
effects so we can enable and disable
that it reads the sky
which is pretty cool
we can control the bounce feedback that
will control how much the light bounces
around or the intensity of the bonds
this is the energy setting
with this you can control how much
influence it has on the scene how much
energy the light has that is bounced
back we can also put this on a negative
value
I don't know why but yeah
you can see the effect this has a pretty
dramatic impact
I'm not always sure if I like it because
sometimes you get these weird artifacts
like over here
so if you want to use it I would
recommend you putting it on a lower
energy
and
um also putting it on a rather low
distance to be honest because otherwise
you will get these really weird effects
in a distance
I'm not sure if I really like this
effect
um
I mean I'm sure if you can if you spend
the time with it you can make it look
good but sometimes I have to feel it
introduces too many artifacts at the
moment
glow is something I almost always add
I like to go in on all levels
it's set at the normalized additive or
screen both are pretty good but I would
usually not pull it on soft light the
effect is very weak
so let's put it on like this Bloom is
something so it will influence all of
the scene I don't want this on for now
fog is also always good and focus also
relatively cheap relatively and you can
see what kind of effect it has on the
background this is something I really
want to have especially to create this
kind of atmospheric effect
so you can see how the light influences
it
and the sunscatter
this is the effect of the sun coming in
the fog
Sky effect
it's also pretty important so if I put
this on it will darken the sky
I don't necessarily want this because
the way that I want to use this effect
is more to create an atmospheric
overcast effect on the background and
not to affect the sky itself
on head you can also create a
I have to turn this on so here we can
also create some ground fog effect
see it like this
it's pretty interesting and if you
turned on the density a bit not so much
just a bit then
it can be really nice like this
just a bit
aerial perspective is only important if
you are working in a non-first person
game for example a top-down game then
you have to use this setting for the fog
and density of course controls the
density of the Fog
and I don't want it too dense I want it
to be more in the background
so let's create some
and I also want it to be more yellowish
like a
Sandy look
and I think I will remove the
the height density again so like this I
think it works a bit better
I would love to have control about the
way it falls off
right now it already influences this
thing here in the front and I would
prefer if it doesn't but anyway let's
keep it in for now
to one of my most favorite effects and
it's called volumetric fog it can add a
lot of atmosphere to use scene with this
fog that is influenced by light and yeah
let's play around with that a bit
so let's turn up the density
let's turn down the sky effect
so now let's play around with those
sliders for a bit
um this is a nice one um this happens
sometimes
but the only thing that helps is to
close the scene
close the viewports
and open it back up again
unfortunately I don't know what causes
it but sometimes the light can go a bit
crazy and then it gets stuck in this
weird overdrive mode
ah now we go okay
probably our camera is in the direct
sunlight
um
let's disable it for now and look what's
the problem here
you can see our camera is in direct
sunlight and that will mean
that this fog is
really hitting the camera So to avoid
this let's just take one of those rocks
let's move it over here a bit let's
rotate it let's put it down like this
and with this we will have a bit more
Shadow on our camera
and what that will do
is to make it much easier to control the
effect and also make it look a bit
better in the game
so let's turn the light again
enable the volumetric again and now
you can see it hits right through here
and if you play around with these
sliders here you can also see how it
changes the scene and with volumetric
fog
you can also see that it really darkens
the scene so we have to do something
about that first I also want it to be
colored a bit like sand
let's go in and turn it down
maybe more like this
and with those sliders you can control
how the looks where it's the most
the most intense effect basically
so I think the default setting is pretty
good here
if you go into your project settings you
will find more control about this effect
here we already have changed settings
from my project this is not the default
settings if you want to look into those
you can just download my project look
into those settings
it's not too different from the default
ones but you can have a look
here the volumetric fox size I turn it
up and as you can see it changes the
quality and the sharpness of it
the more we add here the sharper and the
more detailed it's going to be
but it's also
much more performance hungry let's put
it on 265 and you can see everything
looks a bit dull
this is where we come back to tone map
and we can play with the exposure
so for example if we turn up the
exposure it will get back more contrast
if we put up the white point or change
the white point you can also control how
the scene looks how you put it on Asus
which puts back more contrast
so this is the default setting
this is Asus you can already see it
brings back a lot of contrast
and what I also want to do is to enable
adjustments here
and to add
a color correction texture or gradient
and in here I usually come in
and I put one here and one here and the
one on the top
I color a bit more towards the yellow
side or warm side
not too much just a tiny bit
and the one in the shadows
I put into some cold area like bluish or
purple
Hue and then also increase the
saturation a bit and you can see
how it changes the color on the left
now it's a bit more dramatic if I put it
up all the way then you can see how it
influences the colors in the scene
and what this does and what I use it for
is to create a certain mood in this
scene
usually I want the Shadows to be cool
from the color temperature aspect and
the lights I want to be more warm
so I just add some yellowish Hue here
and you can now see if I enable and
disable it it changes the overall look
quite dramatic
it's not too crazy but I always like to
do this
to color correct the scene
let's hype the ball it's a bit
irritating okay
now we're slowly getting somewhere it's
still
um not perfect
so let's play around with the volumetric
 a bit more
and I think we need just more power in
the directional light
so let's go in there
and let's change the energy here
first we want more volumetric fog energy
so it just looks more intense
I also want more energy overall
and we can put in some intense value
because it's the Sun so it's going to be
bright
let's put it on 10.
and maybe this one too
and now if we go back into the word
environment
we go into the tone map and now we can
play with the exposure
and you can see now it has a really much
more dramatic impact on the light
and what we want now is some detail in
the shadow
and
here indirect light usually comes in
really handy
if we enable the scientist and field
Global illumination
it will already change it quite dramatic
so
we can
we can turn down the energy
a bit like this
what I don't like so much is that it
turns everything so red
that is something I'm not a fan of
I would love to have more control here
but all right
that doesn't seem to do a lot
I mean of course that makes sense if you
think about these rocks being super red
and light reflects back onto this then
the rocks are going to be even more red
makes sense but yeah it's a bit hard to
control the effect like this
so let's go back into the normal Fork
and yeah what I noticed what is not so
great about the volumetric focus that it
influences the light
maybe we can turn that down yeah but now
it starts looking like really weird
um
let's play around with some sliders
yeah we definitely want some Global
illumination injection
because if the light would hit the fog
the fog would also
spread the light so that makes a lot of
sense maybe we don't overdo it but we
can also play with the light later
how strong it is
okay I like this effect much more
now maybe we should go into the sky and
increase the energy there
I think that makes a lot of sense
because like this it looks like a night
scene we want some energy in the sky
maybe we can also make it a bit more
blue
would be cool to have some clouds but
maybe we can look for material later
I think I will disable the ambient light
completely and I need to play around a
bit more with the exposure not too happy
with it and after that I still need to
tune and find you in a bit the settings
on the volumetric fog
and we need to keep details spread up a
bit otherwise it starts to introduce
some artifacts
all right
maybe we should just give it a go
I don't know what happens if we press
play if we get into the first person
camera or not let's see
no we're just going to this camera here
let's stay in this camera and just play
around with the light a bit more
so we could also color it a bit
let's add some more blur to the
directional light shadow
and let's play around with how it looks
I think that already works pretty well
I'm not so sure about the fork the
normal Fork
let's go back to the word environment
check out the fog a bit
but yeah that's not a problem
 is doing a good job
maybe I want a bit less light energy
it's a lot less guns Sun scatters
crazy
I mean it's cool but the problem is that
it's also happening here where I don't
want it to be happening
you know what we can play with the
this
maybe we can just make an kind of like
an inversed
yes this works so maybe we can just keep
the
a bit higher
then we don't have it in the front here
yeah I think that works much better
bit of sunscutter
still a bit too intense in the front but
maybe we can turn down the density a bit
more like this
and now you can see what a big
difference the sign distance feels
Global illumination has
like this looks completely different
and I'm I'm still not a fan of the
reflection where oh
I enabled It Again by mistake
okay
still don't know what this does I have
the feeling it does nothing
okay maybe this is what we want
no effect of the scan of the Sun
and this directional light
has no effect on the indirect light at
the moment or very little
if we turn this up a bit
it may just be what we want
we put it on one it's too much
maybe you 0.5
this is starting to look cool
and you can see if we turn this back on
it's just way too intense
all right slowly we're getting somewhere
let's turn down the saturation a little
bit
and come back into the tone map and
let's try out different looks this is
too much contrast
this is too boring I like filmic I
always like filmic
put the exposure on 0.2
and also if we change the color for
example we go for more
sunset-like atmosphere
could look really nice
and we need also
to um
to change this
something like this could look really
cool
maybe we do something more abstract
and in the back here we can see that
there is this um whoops
this tunnel with the blue light which
will create a nice contrast
but it also creates some problems
because you can see that the fork
already starts disappearing before
we wanted to disappear
so if we put on more distance this is
the distance for the
GI we don't need that but maybe here
let's put it on 64.
think that gives them much nicer fade in
yes this is looking cool
right I'm starting to like this
um so
so now it's time to add back the player
controller and yeah to set it up in a
way so we can walk around in the scene
look at it from first person and as I
already did that in the original demo I
can just reuse most of the code and
assets there and I got the setup done in
a couple of seconds
we could play around with the lighter
bit to basically get the same behavior
that we had before in
in the demo scene so let's add an
animation player
this is like the quickest way to do
things like this and then let's get the
light that we had and I think I want to
add one more light
whoops
in this tunnel thing
one light two
emphasize on this um
this blue light here a bit more
it's either on the light
and now we can also see that it starts
to work it's just fading
so
we need to disable well the distance
fate is already disabled then why is it
not working
why is it fading
hmm
set of volumetric fork
I mean if we increase this this year
we also lose detail
so maybe you see it um
if we set it to a lower value we'll get
more detail in the front
we set it to 12 for example we will have
perfect detail but then we won't have it
in the back
if we set it to 128 we'll lose some
detail in the front
I think I think 64.
I mean this looks really nice
maybe something in between
okay I like this much more
okay so let's animate the light what we
initially wanted to do
um let's
grab the rotation oops I didn't want to
reset it I wanted to make a new track
[Applause]
let's key the rotation
and I don't need to do it 20 seconds or
something like that let's just do five
seconds
and we put one key in the middle
maybe it's like this
now it just doesn't make sense
but somehow it's still not doing what I
want
okay let's
just use this differently
um
you know what we're going to
kill this track
and completely
change how our light will work
so let's reset this
ah
here's the problem
so we have this thing here it's called
lights and it's down here which is fine
let's reset everything here too
reset the scale reset the position so
now we have our light here let's reset
everything
all right
and now let's
put it like this
turn it like this
and if we know
animate rotation of this then we can
change
the sky and it makes more sense for my
brain
maybe for yours too
and if we put it like this
then we can just flip this and it will
create one
nice motion
but what we actually want to do
light source where are you
so one thing that could be really
helpful is to
would be to just disable the environment
like this and now we eventually see a
bit better what we do
where is my light there it is
okay let's reset the rotation again
there's my light source I want it to be
over there like this
and now we can do this and this should
look like
some kind of
day cycle
and then we can just animate
this thing here instead of the light
directly and hopefully it will make it a
bit easier to control
so let's key the rotation
let's move it over one time like this
this is hopefully giving me the effect
that I like
let's go back into our camera
and let's see how it looks from there
so we keep the rotation but what we
didn't key is this rotation so we can
still change this
and this should help us to create a more
interesting pattern basically
I think I like this
alright so now next step is to animate
the light intensity
and also animate
the color
so I want this to be the color in the
morning
and then for noon we go more to a
neutral color
and in the evening it's going to build a
bit more orange
doesn't look too bad and now we also
need to change the energy
and of course we could set this to cubic
but eventually it will create some
problems let's see
and what we also must change is of
course the color of the sky
we can also come in here
and just change this
or we can just change the energy we
don't need to change the color I think
the color was cool so let's change the
energy
a super simple day and night cycle
it's not physically accurate or anything
but it will do its job what we also have
to take care of is the fork
right here it starts look awkward
so let's animate this too
just come in here and we can keyframe
this hopefully why can't we keyframe it
can we key frame this
why
now it works okay
so probably we need to change light
energy
let's
test it out really quick yes okay
[Applause]
you could also change the color probably
looking good
all right and at night we also want to
see something
so what could we do about this
earlier I told you about
[Music]
um
about ambient light
and we can just use a color for that for
example some bluish tone
thing like this maybe
and then we can add some
ambient light and I don't know why it
doesn't work ah now it slowly starts to
work but why it is so black is it the
fork
no it's not a fog
what's going on here
what's going on here
what is causing this
uh-huh
okay well
I have no clue what is causing this
distance
so something weird is going on here
I really don't know what it is
so maybe we just turn it off at night
I mean of course you could also add
another directed light and make it a bit
um like moon light or something like
that we could also try that I'm not a
fan of
of playing around here with um
with this too much somehow it feels
wrong
I don't care let's add another direct
light
oh can we handle this in a graceful way
it annoys me a bit that we can work
around this but um
yeah that's the way it is I let's accept
this
maybe it even looks cooler I don't know
I'm a bit annoyed
anyway
the fork is having a bit too much
influence for my tastes
and the night sky eventually could also
use some energy
what could really work would be adding
stars but let's just keep it black for
now
okay I think this looks good
um
zero really
does this even do anything
that's what's interesting setting it to
zero
give super super soft Shadows
why I don't know
setting it to one doesn't seem to have
this effect but zero gives a really cool
effect maybe I would just keep it at
zero I mean
this looks really cool
does this work why is this working
all right I'll take it
anyway
let's keep it at zero I mean it looks
cool
okay
um
now let's just take this animation
player
let's call it day and night
cycle
let's put it on autoplay
looping and it has a deep loop I never
tested it but probably not ah it kind of
loops
maybe we just add seven seconds that's
it
put on seven
and not
all right
all right um all that's left to do now
is to add some effects luckily we
already have some
we can take the fireflies we can take
the sand particles
copy those over
let's put them in here too the same
particles are pretty cool they also get
hit by the Light shafts
let's turn them up a bit more to see
them a bit better
but yeah let's not do the fireflies
let's just do the same particles I don't
want to animate any more stuff
and let's start the scene and let's have
a look
oh yeah this is some crazy day night
cycle
uh I want this to be slower so let's go
in and let's set this tool
0.2 or something like this
it's a little bit too fast
this
yeah I think this could work
maybe that's a bit too much fork for the
overcast day
let's go in the animation player let's
check it out here and maybe let's reduce
the volumetric fog intensity at the
middle of the day
all right
um so
let's add some music and we're done
let's just see where we placed um the
wind should be here
Second Wind can be
here
the music chimes in the tunnel
at the normal music is everywhere
so let's try it out I'm gonna shut up
now and uh yeah we kind of look how it
sounds and feels
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
but I have one last thing one idea that
I want to try out so we still have the
blocks here and we have the scene here
and the entrance and the outside detail
and all kind of the these things that
we've started to put in
but
just for fun I want to see how this
blocked out scene looks and if we landed
somewhere remotely close
so
let's just play the animation and have a
look
and you can see how even with a
completely different geometry the
atmosphere that we created and the light
and Shadow and the mood still holds up
pretty well
I think yeah we managed to put together
a pretty nice setup
and having a setup like this also allows
you to go back and check if some
settings still make sense if they really
look good the simpler the geometry the
easier it is to see how the light
interacts and how the light works
and if it really looks good or if it's
just for example diffused or blurred by
the textures you use or by the effects
you use
having simple geometry yeah just shows
the floss very well like for example
here you can see those those splotches
and those are probably introduced from
the global illumination if we turn the
global illumination illumination down a
bit
those are a little less visible we can
also play with the settings here
yeah
of course you can also always go into
the project settings and play around
there with the values
um if we go here to environment
we can also
set things there change the quality
levels here
and of course also depending on your
scene
but this is not the only way to do stuff
you can also for example add a voxler GI
you could bake your light if you don't
have a dynamic light going in there you
could just bake the light which also
gives a really high quality light
yeah you want to consider different
options
and then just slide the sliders until
stuff looks good
that's it for today I hope you enjoyed
the video even if the format was a lot
more chaotic than usually and if you
enjoyed it follow me here on YouTube hit
the bell and all the stuff you know the
drill and yeah I'm mostly posting on
Twitter so if you find it interesting
follow me there
I'll also upload the scene into the
desert light repository so if you want
to have a look on your PC you can just
clone the repository have a look hope
you enjoyed it see you next time bye
