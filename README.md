Running the Benchmark
------

We will be providing a test harness soon. 

If you wish to run the benchmark by yourself, note that you should do the following:
1. Always open (programatically is fine) each task in godot before running the task.
2. Create a clean environment without the tests. Otherwise the agents will cheat.
3. do NOT unpack the ground truth files. Agents will find it and cheat.
